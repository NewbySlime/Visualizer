Case of msgcode

Note:
  - At least a length of 4 bytes for header buffer
  - If every msgcode doesn't have any format, then it is the usual 2 bytes header


PINGMESSAGE
To keep the connection going by sending or reading it every pollrate. It doesn't need to get another feedback PINGMESSAGE, it could be any other code message.



SENDMESSAGE
Sending a message.

Format: hhhh
  - 4 h bytes is a header bytes consist of msgcode (2) and msglen (2).
  - then followed by the message packets



EOBULKMESSAGE
Message code to tell the listener or remote that there's no other message (not packet) incoming. Cannot be sent unless it's after SENDMESSAGE and there's no other message.



UDPS_MSG
The base format of UDP socket message.



UDPS_CONNECTMSG (sent once)
This will make sure that the socket is actually connected, and bind the ip and port to make sure another remote sender cannot connect to it.



UDPS_DISCONNECTMSG (sent once)
Based on the name, it will disconnect and makes it available for other remote sender to connect.



UDPS_SETPOLLRATE
This will tell listener or remote to change its polling rate.

Format: hhp
  - 2 h bytes is a message code (2)
  - 1 p byte is the polling rate (1)



UDPS_MSGACCEPTED
A needed feedback after getting a message packet.



UDPS_MAXMSGSIZE
Sets how many bytes the remote or listener can handle in a single message.
If the length is -1, then the message can be as long as the remote/listener can physically handle.
