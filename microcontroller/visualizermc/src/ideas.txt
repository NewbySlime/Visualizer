how rgb works

here's some constraint that will be used.

  gradient with colors, for making the gradient of color across leds

  speed for how fast the led switch color (gradient per ms)

  how long the portion of the gradient used per strip (0f - 1f)

  how many leds are used
  and how to split each of them
  can be set to sync with another split
  and can be set to use reversed color placement for each split


for sound mode

  set use brightness (this will use brightness for the intensity measure)
  set use color (this will use gradient of color for the intensity)
    one of this should be on

  set individual band

  how many bands per led



modes
  for colour:
    - static (only one colour, can't be changed, unless manually)
    - rgb (colour changes according to gradient)
    - sound (colour changes according to sound)
  notes:
    - if in sound mode and the led state is in static mode,
      the amount of intensity is averaged across bands in union
    - if in sound mode and the led state is in dynamic mode,
      it will be normal, colour changing according to each bands
  
  for led state (could be brightness or colour changing):
    for colour:
      - union (colour changing in union)
      - individual (colour changing individually, using rgb settings)
    for brightness (sound only):
      - sound-union (brightness changing in union according to sound)
      - sound-individual (brightness changing individually according to sound)
  notes:
    - for colour shifting, it should have an option to use motion or intensity
